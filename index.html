    <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>

    <p>
        I chose to base my project on gaming because it has always been a big part of my life.
        I like how games bring people together, whether that's playing online with friends or
        meeting new people who enjoy the same games. Gaming is more than just playing, it's
        teamwork, communication, and sometimes even problem-solving. I want to explore how
        gaming has grown and what it means to different people.
